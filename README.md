At Prodigy InfoTech, this is my second internship assignment. I had to manipulate pixels to construct a very basic image encryption tool. I applied fundamental mathematical processes on every pixel. Both encrypting and decrypting the image can be done by users by providing an encryption key. However, due to its simplicity, encryption is simple to perform, but the process of decrypting results in a loss of image quality. The original image and the decoded version will differ.
